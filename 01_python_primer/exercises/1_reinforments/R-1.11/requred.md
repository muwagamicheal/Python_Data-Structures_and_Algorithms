## Assignment
Demonstrate how to use Pythonâ€™s list comprehension syntax to produce
the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256].?

## Solution(s)
### Usage of List comprehension.
A very common programming task is to produce one series of values based upon the processing of another series. Often, this task can be accomplished quite simply in Python using what is known as a comprehension syntax. 
Its general form is as follows.
  [ expression **for** value **in** iteratable **if** condition(s)]
### Analysing the assignment
The first number in the sequence is 1 this is used to set the start parameter, the difference between consective numbers in the string is that the next number is double the previous and this sets the step parameter, and the last number on the sequence is 256, meaning the stop parameter was set to 10.
