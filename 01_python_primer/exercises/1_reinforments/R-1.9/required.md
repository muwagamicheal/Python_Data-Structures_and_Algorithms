### Assignment
What parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a range with values 50, 60, 70, 80?

## Solution(s)
### Usage of  the range()
This assinment requires us to have knowlwdge of the builtin range() in python works.
It takes three parameters, start, stop, step. 
The "start" parameter tells function the start value of the output.
"stop" parameter tells the function the end value of the output
"step" parameter tell the function the number of values to be skiped when generating the next value.

NOTE: 
If the "start" value is not supplied, the default of 1 will be assumed.
If the "stop" value is not supplied the function will return an empty list.
If the "step" is not provided, the default of one will be assumed.

### Analysing the assignment
The first number in the sequence is 50 this is used to set the start parameter, the difference between consective numbers in the string is 10 and this sets the step parameter, and the last number on the sequence is 80, meaning the stop parameter was set to any number between 81 and 100.
