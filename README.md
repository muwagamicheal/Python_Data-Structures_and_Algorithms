# Python_Data-Structures_and_Algorithms
Notes and Solutions to exercises from the book Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich,  Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser 

# Desired out comes for me after reading this book include:
1. Gain knowledge of common abstractions for data collections(e.g,lists, stacks, ques, trees, maps).
2. Understand strategies for producing effient implelemtations of the common data structures in python.
3. Understand how to analyse the performance of algorithims, both theoretically and experimentally, and recognise common trade-offs between competing strategies.
4. Wisely use data structure and algorithims found in python.
5. Apply data structure and algorithims to solve complex problems.
