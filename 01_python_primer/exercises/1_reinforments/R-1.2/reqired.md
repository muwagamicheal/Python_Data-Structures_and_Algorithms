## Assignment

Write a short Python function, is even(k), that takes an integer value and
returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. However, your function
cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators.

## Solution(s)
### 1. Using the bitwise & operator
In this approach we shall use the bitwise and operator to if the numberis even.
### 2. Using conditional loops
In this approach we use the while loop subtract two from the number until the number is equal to or less than two.
### 3. Using Regular Expressions
In this appproach we shall use regular expressions to check if the last digit of the number is 0,2,4,6,8 then the numbe is even
