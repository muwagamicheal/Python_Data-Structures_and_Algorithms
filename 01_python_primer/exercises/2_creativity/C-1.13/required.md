## Assignment
Write a pseudo-code description of a function that reverses a list of n integers, so that the numbers are listed in the opposite order than they were before, and compare this method to an equivalent Python function for doing the same thing.

### Solution(s)
## Using negative indexing
By default a sequence is created and indexed starting from 0 up to the length of the sequence n.
To reverse this sequence i will use a for loop and range function to iterated on the list in reverse order.
