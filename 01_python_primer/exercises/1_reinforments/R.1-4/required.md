## Assignment
Write a short Python function that takes a positive integer n and returns the sum of the squares of all the positive integers smaller than n.

## Solution(s)
### 1. Using conditional loops
In this approach i will use an if statement to check in the user input is postive, and an for loop to generate and sum the squares of the numbers that are less than n.

## Future Improvments
1. Improve this code to check if user input is number. If user enters a string or symbol the program should return a warning and request user to enter a postive number.
